• I participated in a scientific initiation scholarship, where I created a portal for the math course that provided exercises, papers, articles, and games.

• I took part in the Rondon project, a voluntary social initiative where I traveled to Mato Grosso to teach basic computer skills to low-income and indigenous communities.
