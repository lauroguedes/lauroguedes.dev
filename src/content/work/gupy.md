I participated in technical improvements and complex integrations with communication platforms like MS Teams and Slack. I also contributed to productivity enhancements in legacy systems, including configuring XDebug in Docker and debugging unit tests, and helped identify the root cause of incidents and bugs. Additionally, I shared knowledge with the team on productive debugging techniques and PHPUnit unit testing, and created technical documentation for the enhancements made.
